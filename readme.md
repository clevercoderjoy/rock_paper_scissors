=============================================ROCK==========PAPER==========SCISSORS==========================================================
-> This is my first python project.
-> This project contains the code for a simple cmd line based rock, paper and scissors game.
-> I have used the concepts of basic python programming and function calling mostly for this project.
-> As the code is executed, the command prompt displays the message to choose between rock, paper and scissors.
-> The game ends when the user enters 'n' when prompted to enter a choice between 'y' or 'n' respectively for yes or no to continue the game.
-> Once the game has ended the player can see the detailed final results.
